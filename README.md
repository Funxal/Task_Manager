Here’s a concise, one-paragraph version of your description:


---

Python Task Manager is a full-featured task management application built with Python, featuring both a command-line interface (CLI) and a REST API powered by FastAPI. It is designed using object-oriented programming principles and supports JSON-based data persistence, task priorities, and deadlines. The project allows users to manage tasks efficiently via CLI (python task_manager.py) or interact programmatically through a FastAPI backend (uvicorn main:app --reload), making it a versatile tool for personal or small-team task tracking.
